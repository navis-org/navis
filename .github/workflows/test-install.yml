# The purpose of this workflow is to test a full install
# as opposed to cloning + pip install -e which is what we
# do for the other tests. The main difference here is that
# we do a proper install including building wheels from the
# source distribution. This will reveal any issue in with
# the configuration (e.g. if `find_packages` is not correctly
# configured)
