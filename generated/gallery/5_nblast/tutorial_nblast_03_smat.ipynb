        "\nCustom score matrices\n=====================\n\nThis tutorial shows how to train a custom score matrix for NBLAST.\n\nThe core of the NBLAST algorithm is a function which converts point matches (defined by a distance and the dot product of the tangent\nvectors) into a score expressing how likely they are to have come from the same cell type. This function is typically a 2D lookup table,\nreferred to as the \"score matrix\", generated by \"training\" it on sets of neurons known to be either matching or non-matching.\n\n{{ navis }} provides (and uses by default) the score matrix used in the original publication (Costa et al., 2016) which is based on\nFlyCircuit, a light-level database of _Drosophila_ neurons. Let's quickly visualize this:\n"

        "This scoring matrix works suprisingly well in many cases! However, how appropriate it is for\nyour data depends on a number of factors:\n\n- How big your neurons are (commonly addressed by scaling the distance axis of the built-in score matrix)\n- How you have pre-processed your neurons (pruning dendrites, resampling etc.)\n- Your actual task (matching left-right pairs, finding lineages etc.)\n- How distinct you expect your matches and non-matches to be (e.g. how large a body volume you're drawing neurons from)\n\nUtilities in `navis.nbl.smat` allow you to train your own score matrix.\n\nLet's first have a look at the relevant classes:\n\n"
